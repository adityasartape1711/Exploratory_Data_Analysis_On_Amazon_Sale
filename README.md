## Amazon Sales Data Analysis

### Overview
This project performs an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an Amazon sales dataset. The aim is to understand customer behavior, product trends, and pricing strategies based on reviews, product details, and pricing data. The insights obtained from this analysis can help businesses make data-driven decisions to optimize their sales strategies.

### Project Description
The Amazon Sales Data Analysis project involves cleaning, transforming, and analyzing data related to Amazon products, reviews, ratings, and pricing. Using Python and libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project explores key patterns, such as rating distributions, pricing trends, discount structures, and customer preferences. It provides a structured approach to understanding online shopping behavior and reviews data for e-commerce analysis.

### Key Features
- **Data Cleaning:** Handles missing values, data type conversions, and necessary transformations.
- **Detailed EDA:** Examines product pricing, discounts, ratings, and category-wise distributions.
- **Visualization:** Uses plots to represent insights on sales, review counts, rating distributions, and more.
- **Top Products and Users:** Identifies top-reviewed products and most active reviewers.
- **Discount Analysis:** Analyzes discount patterns and their relation to product ratings and prices.

### Technologies Used
- **Python:** Programming language used for data analysis.
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** Numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Data visualization libraries for generating insights.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Development environment for running the EDA.
